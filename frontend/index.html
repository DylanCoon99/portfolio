        Hi! My name is Dylan Coon and I am from Erie, Pennsylvania. I’m a software engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and a passion for solving complex problems. I graduated from Penn State University with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics, where I built a deep understanding of algorithms, systems, and logical thinking - skills I apply daily in my work and personal projects. I am proficient in Go, Python, C and familiar with Javascript. I have worked with GCP quite a bit as well as AWS on occasion. I am always eager to learn new languages and tools.

        I started my career as an intern at Iron Mountain - an information management company known for their cloud based solutions they provide to hundreds of clients globally. As an intern, I worked on a ML team that specialize in model optimization and refactoring for intelligent document processing. I wrote python code to extract signatures from documents and structure training data in a concurrent manner using a threading library. Currently, I’m a software engineer at the company, where I work on an application support team. I spend most of my time leveraging my Python skills to automate workflows, gather metrics, and monitor cloud environments. I also help validate new releases in production. I enjoy working with data, writing clean APIs, and diving into technical challenges. My main interests lie in backend development, distributed systems, and machine learning.

        Outside of work, I like to be outside and spend time with my dog Yankee. I am also an avid rock climber — I love the mental and physical puzzle that each climb presents. It’s a great complement to my love of problem-solving in software. If you'd like to connect, don't hesitate to leave me a message below.
